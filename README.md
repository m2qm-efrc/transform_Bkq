# transform_Bkq

The purpose of this this code is two fold. 1. Transform the crystal field parameters (CFPs) Bkq for extended Stevens operators (ESOs) under a rotation of the reference frame. 2. Transform the ESO-based crystal field parameters into ITO-based crystal field parameters, and vice versa, where ITO stands for irreducible tensor operators.

Usage:

```python rotate_Bkq.py``` to rotate the CFPs Bkq under a rotation of the reference frame.

```python transform_Bkq.py``` to transform the CFPs Bkq from ESO to ITO basis, and vice versa.
